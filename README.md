## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Used grid-auto-flow to auto-fill items into a defined grid container.
- Used width: auto on image so that it will display in it's original size rather than occupying only spaces within it's parent element.
- Used pseudo-elements to add two box-shadow on the buttons.

### Continued development

- Familiarise with align properties like justify-content, align-items for grid as I still have to depend on trial-and-error to determine the correct properties to use.

### Useful resources

- [grid-auto-flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-flow) - This documentation helped me understand the grid-auto-flow property.
- [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Still my go-to reference when building layouts with grid.

## Acknowledgments

Practice is a very important learning stage in coding, and I want to thank [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) for making it easier for me to do that. With their help, I can focus on understanding the different properties in HTML and CSS with my minimal knowledge on UI and UX design.
